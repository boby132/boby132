The inquiry will attempt to determine why the student failed and whether there is reason to believe that he will meet the required academic standards within the remaining study period of the student. As a result of this inquiry, students may be placed on probation if it is determined by the respective academic councils that:
133.2.1.	Valid reasons exist to explain their low academic performance;
133.2.2.	Those causes for their academic deficiencies can be removed; and

If the student does not remove the “Grade after repeating twice and if such course is not in the Major Course category, the DC/SC may adjudge the course as “allergic” and suggest an equivalent course to be approved by the CC/IC/FC/SC. If an equivalent course cannot be found, a course waiver may be suggested by the CC/IC/FC/SC and approved by the ASPRC. Where the course in which the student scores an “F”,   grade for the third time is in the Major Course category, the student shall be dismissed for good. 
135.2.	If the student scores an "F” grade for the “allergic course” he has registered, he shall be dismissed for good.
135.3.	A student shall not be allowed to register for a course determined as allergic more than once throughout his stay in the programme.
